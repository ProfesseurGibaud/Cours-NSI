How to teach these courses ?
1째) Write everything in a jupyter Notebook (in order to keep the same format for students)
2째) After each session there will be applications to do during and outside the class (to cement the informations)
3째) After each chapter, students have to make summary of the course and a cheat sheet. 
4째) The cheat sheet will be available to the test but the length will have an upper bound.

In addition, there will be more explanations on the black board (students can draw it on papers and add them (the photo to their jupyter notebook)).

There will be 4 kinds of grades:
- The computer science exercice to do in class
- The theoric exercices to do in class
- The medium/long term project and their presentation
- The small exercises to make one session to the other
